# Geometry homework

In order to practise inheritance and polymorphism.

1. Create class representing generic geometric shape
1. Create several different classes representing geometric shapes and inheriting from the class created in the previous step.
1. Define and implement at least two pure virtual functions. Suggested:
   - virtual double area() const = 0;
   - virtual double perimeter() const = 0;
1. Implement a container filled with several shapes and printing area and perimeter (or respective) in a uniform way (using those virtual functions).
